# Be-Equal
Individual Project made to Mobile Devices Programming Subject

## Proposal

This proposal was submitted by Dr. Marta Alves, from the Department of Psychology.

## Objectives


The main objective of this work is to implement an application / mini-game that allows to explore human rights issues, namely gender equality and non-violence. The idea is to implement an application that puts scenarios into shape
text (and possibly an image) and ask a question that seeks to captivate user criticism of those themes (an example of a scenario below). The simplest version can have a set of three scenarios and three questions.
hardcoded, but you should at least be able to save the answers for different uses of the platform (eg, if I answer today one way and tomorrow another, both answers must be saved and available in a history). The application should present the scenarios in isolated activities, with the question at the end of the text. The initial activity must have at least three buttons:
(i) a button to evolve to preferences
(specify username);
(ii) a button to go to the analysis and response to
scenarios;
(iii) a button to view the history. Scenarios should be presented one by one consecutively.

In the more elaborate version, the application may try to draw a report from the answers given, presented at the end of the scenario analysis. On the other hand, the application may also support more than one user. Finally, it may contain an administration zone that allows you to add more scenarios and issues locally.

E.g. of a scenario:

My boyfriend tells me daily that he likes me very much and asked me to
access keys to my phone.

E.g. of questions:

If it were up to you, do you think you should give him that information?
Options:

1. Yes, he says he likes me, so jealousy justifies that he wants to control
what I do with my phone.
2. Yes, because our relationship is based on trust and I know that it will not make me
bad.
3. I do not give access keys to my mobile phone because they are personal.
4. I only give this information if he also gives me access keys to his mobile phone.

E.g. of the sentence to be added in the final report (advanced functionality, see above):
• if you selected option 1, 2 or 4,

Please note that personal data or objects are private and should not have any implication.
or depend on your relationship with your boyfriend.

• if you selected option 3,
Your answer to question X goes against what is believed to be the best approach in this situation.
